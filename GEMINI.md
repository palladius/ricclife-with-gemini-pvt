This is my catch-all repo for all Gemini researches and tasks.

## Feedback loop

* Keep an increasing `VERSION` file and a colorful/emojiful `CHANGELOG.md`.
* use `gitmoji`


# DOs

* Use folders for the win.
* Whenever I come to you with a problem, try to create a file with "YYYYMMDD-short-synopsis.md" which explain what the problem is, this way i can git add for future reference.
* we'll figure out how to archive old solved tasks.
* Use github issue tracking (via `gh`) to solve
* Sign your git commits with your agent name (Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Gemini API, ..) whatever works best.

# DONT's

* Do NOT pollute a generic folder with a particular issue. Try to compartimentailze the issue in a subfolder or GH issue. Anything outside it should eb a reusable tool or piece of code.
